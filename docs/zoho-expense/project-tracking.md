# Project Tracking

## Assigning Expenses to Projects

If an expense belongs to a specific project (e.g., Meal Subsidy or Baby Hamper), make sure to assign it to that project so costs can be tracked accurately.

## Bulk Updating a Report's Project

To update multiple expenses at once:

1. Open the expense report in Zoho Expense.
2. Select all relevant expenses using the checkboxes.
3. Click **Bulk Update**.

4. In the **Bulk Field Update** menu:
   - Choose the correct **Customer** (the project/program name).
   - Select the matching **Project** (which includes the academic/fiscal year).

5. Click **Update** to apply the changes to all selected expenses.

## Naming Convention Reminder

Record project expenses using the standard format:

```
ProjectNameF/AYear_MonthYear_Number
```

**Example**: A report for Baby Hamper expenses in October 2025 would be titled:

```
BabyHamper2526AY_202510_1
```

See [Creating New Projects]({% link docs/zoho-expense/creating-projects.md %}) for the full naming convention breakdown.

{: .important }
> Always verify that the Customer and Project fields match before submitting the report. Misassigned expenses create extra work during monthly reconciliation.
