# Project Tracking

## Assigning Expenses to Projects

If an expense belongs to a specific project (e.g., Meal Subsidy or Baby Hamper), make sure to assign it to that project so costs can be tracked accurately.

## Bulk Updating a Report's Project

To update multiple expenses at once:

1. Open the expense report in Zoho Expense.
2. Select all relevant expenses using the checkboxes.
3. Click **Bulk Update**.

4. In the **Bulk Field Update** menu:
   - Choose the correct **Customer** (the project/program name).
   - Select the matching **Project** (which includes the academic/fiscal year).

5. Click **Update** to apply the changes to all selected expenses.

## Project Naming Convention

When selecting the project in the bulk update dialog, use the standard naming format:

```
[Project Type] [Year Range] [Cycle Type]
```

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Project Type | Name of the initiative | `AO Funding` |
| Year Range | Two-digit start-end years | `25-26` |
| Cycle Type | AY (Academic Year, Sep–Aug), FY (Fiscal Year, Jun–May), or CY (Calendar Year, Jan–Dec) | `FY` |

**Example**: `AO Funding 25-26 FY`

See [Zoho Projects]({% link docs/zoho-expense/zoho-projects.md %}) for full details on creating projects and naming conventions.

{: .important }
> Always verify that the **Customer** and **Project** fields match before submitting the report. Misassigned expenses create extra work during monthly reconciliation.
