# Report Submission

## What Are Zoho Expense Reports?

In Zoho Expense, a **report** is a submission package that groups related expenses together for review and approval. Reports serve several important functions:

- Enable the finance team to validate and approve expenses as a batch
- Ensure expenses are posted to the correct accounting period
- Maintain organized records by month, department, and project
- Create an audit trail for financial reviews and compliance

Think of reports as expense claim forms—they package your individual expense items into a single submission for processing.

## Monthly Submission Requirements

All staff and executives must follow these practices:

### 1. Submit Expenses Monthly

**Submit all expenses at the end of each month**, even if you have minimal expenses.

**Why this matters:**
- **Accurate financial reporting**: Expenses are allocated to the correct accounting period
- **Budget monitoring**: Monthly submissions allow real-time tracking of departmental spending
- **Timely reimbursement**: Regular submissions prevent delays in getting reimbursed
- **Better record keeping**: Submitting expenses soon after they occur ensures accurate descriptions and proper documentation
- **Reduced administrative burden**: Small, regular submissions are easier to review than large, delayed ones

<!--
{: .warning }
> Delayed submissions can result in expenses being recorded in the wrong fiscal period, causing budget discrepancies and complicating year-end financial reporting.
-->

### 2. Group Expenses by Type or Project

**Create separate reports for different types of expenses or projects.** This significantly simplifies the approval process.

**Examples of logical groupings:**
- All meeting-related expenses (catering, room rentals, supplies)
- All expenses for a specific project (e.g., Orientation 2025, AO Funding)
- Travel expenses for a single trip or conference
- Regular monthly service payments (subscriptions, contractors)
- Office supplies and equipment purchases

**Why this matters:**
- **Faster approvals**: Reviewers can quickly understand and approve related expenses together
- **Clearer context**: Grouped expenses tell a coherent story (e.g., all costs for one event)
- **Easier tracking**: Project-based reports make it simple to monitor specific budgets
- **Better documentation**: Related receipts and justifications stay together

> You may submit multiple reports per month if you have expenses that fall into different categories or projects. For example, submit one report for "Meeting Expenses" and another for "Travel to Conference."

### 3. Use the Standard Report Name Format

Consistent naming helps finance staff quickly identify and process reports.

## Report Name Format

Use this exact format for all report titles:
```
YYYY-MM | ##-DEPT | Category | Short description
```

**Format Breakdown:**

| Component | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `YYYY-MM` | Year and month of expense period | `2025-01`, `2025-11` |
| `##-DEPT` | Department code (see table below) | `10-CORP`, `13-VPEXT` |
| `Category` | Use one of the standard category names listed below | `Governance & Meetings`, `Travel & Conferences` |
| `Short description` | Brief explanation | `Council retreat`, `Conference in Toronto` |

**Department Codes:**

| Code | Department |
|------|------------|
| `10-CORP` | Corporate |
| `11-PRES` | President |
| `12-VPUAA` | Vice President University and Academic Affairs |
| `13-VPEXT` | Vice President External Relations |
| `14-VPSTD` | Vice President Students |
| `15-FO` | Financial Officer |

## Recommended Category Names and Account Mapping

Use these category names in the `Category` part of report titles:

| Category | Use For (Expense Account Codes) |
