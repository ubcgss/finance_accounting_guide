# Guide for Submitting Expenses to Zoho

## Receipt Requirements

All expense submissions must include proper documentation:

- **PDF invoices** are preferred when available
- **Photos of receipts** are acceptable if taken in a flat, well-lit area with a clear background
- Every receipt must clearly show:
  - Date of purchase
  - Merchant name
  - Total amount paid
  - Itemized description of purchases

**For restaurant expenses:** Provide photos of both the itemized receipt AND the payment receipt showing tip. Restaurant tips should not exceed 18%.

## How to Fill in Expense Details

1. **Description**
   - Enter what was purchased, where, and for what business purpose
   - Be specific enough that anyone reviewing the expense report can immediately understand what it relates to and why it's being claimed
   - Example: "Yearly Adobe subscription for communications team"

2. **Customer and Project**
   - Use these fields to tag project-related expenses
   - Example: Select "AO Funding" as the customer and "AO Funding 25-26 FY" as the project

3. **Budget Line**
   - The head of department (VPs + managers) should specify the budget line
   - If unsure, consult with the Financial Officer to ensure the expense is allocated correctly
   - Correct budget line allocation is crucial for accurate financial reporting and future budgeting

4. **Reimbursement Details**
   - **T4A Reportable Payment (CRA)**
     - Check this box ONLY if payment is made to an **individual** (not a corporation) for scholarships, awards, honoraria, or service-based compensation
     - Do NOT check this box for payments to corporations, expense reimbursements, or payroll (which uses T4)
   - **Payee Name:** Full legal name of the person or entity being paid or reimbursed
   - **Interac e-Transfer Email:** The email address for receiving Interac e-Transfer payments (for individuals)
   - **EFT/Bulk Transfer Details:** Provide complete banking information in this format:
     - Institution number - Transit number - Account number, Currency
     - Example: `123-12345-12345678, CAD`
     - For multiple email addresses, separate each with a comma
