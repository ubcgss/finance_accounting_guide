# Expense Submission

## Receipt Requirements

All expense submissions must include proper documentation:

- **PDF invoices** are preferred when available
- **Photos of receipts** are acceptable if taken in a flat, well-lit area with a clear background
- Every receipt must clearly show:
  - Date of purchase
  - Merchant name
  - Total amount paid
  - Itemized description of purchases

**For restaurant expenses:** Provide photos of both the itemized receipt AND the payment receipt showing tip. Restaurant tips should not exceed 18%.

## How to Fill in Expense Details

1. **Description**
   - Enter what was purchased, where, and for what business purpose
   - Be specific enough that anyone reviewing the expense report can immediately understand what it relates to and why it's being claimed
   - Example: "Yearly Adobe subscription for communications team"

2. **Customer and Project**
   - Use these fields to tag project-related expenses
   - Example: Select "AO Funding" as the customer and "AO Funding 25-26 FY" as the project

3. **Budget Line**
   - The head of department (VPs + managers) should specify the budget line
   - If unsure, consult with the Financial Officer to ensure the expense is allocated correctly
   - Correct budget line allocation is crucial for accurate financial reporting and future budgeting

4. **Reimbursement Details**
   - **T4A Reportable Payment (CRA)**
     - Check this box ONLY if payment is made to an **individual** (not a corporation) for scholarships, awards, honoraria, or service-based compensation
     - Do NOT check this box for payments to corporations, expense reimbursements, or payroll (which uses T4)
   - **Payee Name:** Full legal name of the person or entity being paid or reimbursed
   - **Interac e-Transfer Email:** The email address for receiving Interac e-Transfer payments (for individuals)
   - **EFT/Bulk Transfer Details:**
     - For bulk transfers (e.g. chair honoraria and GSFA payments), please use [this template]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/Plooto_Bulkpayment_Import_template.xlsx) to enter the recipients' details and amounts, and upload the same Excel sheet in Zoho Expense.
     - Please ensure that all email addresses are correct, as we will not be able to verify them. It will be your responsibility to ensure the emails are accurate and updated before submission.
