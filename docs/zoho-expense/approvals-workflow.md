# Approvals Workflow

## Schedule

Zoho expense reports are reviewed and approved on a **semi-monthly cycle**:

{: .deadline }
> **14th of each month** — First approval cycle
> **29th/30th of each month** — Second approval cycle

The Financial Officer is responsible for reviewing pending reports and reminding other executives to complete their approvals on time.

## Approval Chain

Expense reports pass through multiple levels of review before they are finalized:

| Step | Approver | Responsibility |
|------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Department Head** | Verifies the expense is valid and within the department's budget |
| 2 | **President or VPUAA** | Executive-level sign-off |
| 3 | **Financial Officer** | Reviews for policy compliance and budget alignment |
| 4 | **Bookkeeper (Bickert)** | Records the expense in the accounting system |

## How to Review and Approve Reports

1. Log in to [Zoho Expense](https://expense.zoho.com).
2. Click **Approvals** in the left sidebar.
3. Review each pending report:
   - Verify the expense descriptions are clear and accurate.
   - Check that receipts or supporting documents are attached.
   - Confirm the correct **Customer** and **Project** are assigned (see [Project Tracking]({% link docs/zoho-expense/project-tracking.md %})).
   - Ensure the amounts are reasonable and within budget.
4. Click **Approve** or **Reject** with comments if clarification is needed.

{: .tip }
> On each approval date, send a reminder to executives who have pending approvals. Delays in the approval chain hold up reconciliation and financial reporting.

## Expenses Requiring Prior Approval

Per GSS policy, any expense exceeding **$100** requires prior approval before the purchase is made. The approval must come from the appropriate Department Head or executive.
