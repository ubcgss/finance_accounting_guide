# Zoho Usage Guide

The GSS uses [Zoho Expense](https://expense.zoho.com) as the primary platform for tracking expenses, managing projects, and processing approvals. This section covers the key workflows staff need to follow.

## Key Concepts

- **Expense Reports**: Collections of individual expenses submitted for approval and reimbursement.
- **Projects**: Categories used to track costs for specific initiatives (e.g., Meal Subsidy, Baby Hamper). Every expense that belongs to a specific initiative must be assigned to its project.
- **Approval Chain**: Expense reports go through multiple levels of approval — Department Head, President/VPUAA, Financial Officer, and Bookkeeper.
