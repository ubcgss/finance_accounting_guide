# Creating New Projects on Zoho

## What Are Zoho Projects?

Zoho projects are categories within Zoho Expense that allow us to track costs associated with specific GSS initiatives, events, or programs. Each project groups related expenses together so the Financial Officer, General Manager, and House-Finance Committee can review spending by initiative.

Examples of GSS projects:
- **Meal Subsidy** — subsidized meals for graduate students
- **Baby Hamper** — care packages for new parents
- **Orientation** — fall and spring orientation events
- **Graduate Life Centre Events** — events hosted at the Centre

## When to Create a New Project

Create a new project when:
- A new GSS program or initiative is approved by Council or HFC
- A new fiscal/academic year begins (projects are year-specific)
- An existing initiative has a distinct funding source that needs separate tracking

{: .important }
> Projects follow the GSS fiscal year (June 1 — May 31). At the start of each fiscal year, create new projects for recurring initiatives with the updated year code.

## How to Create a New Project

1. Log in to [Zoho Expense](https://expense.zoho.com).
2. Navigate to **Admin** in the left sidebar.
3. Select **Projects** under the General section.
4. Click **+ New Project**.
5. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Customer**: Select the program name (this acts as the parent category).
   - **Project Name**: Use the naming convention below.
   - **Description**: Brief description of what the project funds.
6. Click **Save**.

## Project Naming Convention

All projects must follow this format:

```
ProjectNameF/AYear_MonthYear_Number
```

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `ProjectName` | Short name with no spaces | `BabyHamper` |
| `F/AYear` | Fiscal or academic year code | `2526AY` (for 2025-26) |
| `MonthYear` | Month and year of the report | `202510` (October 2025) |
| `Number` | Sequential number for that month | `1`, `2`, etc. |

**Full example**: `BabyHamper2526AY_202510_1` — the first Baby Hamper expense report for October 2025 in the 2025-26 academic year.

{: .tip }
> Be consistent with project names across the fiscal year. If you name the first report `MealSubsidy2526AY_202506_1`, all subsequent Meal Subsidy reports should start with `MealSubsidy2526AY`.
